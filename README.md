# Turing Machine

A university project for Computer Theory course at Federal University of Bahia. Me and my group implemented a Turing Machine in order to solve an adaptation of the problem Radars available on URI online judge. The specification of the problem as its implementation is written in pdf file. To generate a machine it's necessary to write a code following the steps written in Specifications file about the language and run this code necessarily named "in" in generator.py. This will produce a file named "out" containing the desired machine and in order to run this machine you should run the file "out" in [Turing Machine Simulator](https://turingmachinesimulator.com/) website.
